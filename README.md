👋 Wellcome to my GitHub profile. 

I’m a person characterized by a constant desire to learn new skills and new ways of doing things. 
I also possess strong listening abilities, adaptability, and empathy.

My artistic background provided me with the tools to work in teams, collaborate with others to achieve a common goal, such as a show production. 
It also taught me how to effectively communicate and express my ideas.

Regarding IT, I am familiar with the full software development lifecycle, from planning to development and production deployment.
I have worked on projects in university, bootcamps, and on my own, which involved all stages of development. 
I’m capable of estimating technical requirements for a system and designing databases through diagrams and translating them into SQL code.

When it comes to development, I focus on writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code while following best practices. 
Above all, I prioritize making the code understandable for others.
I have deployed Java applications in cloud environments like Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Render.

I am constantly seeking new challenges that allow me to keep learning and growing professionally. 

I enjoy tackling complex problems and working in teams to create efficient and sustainable solutions.
